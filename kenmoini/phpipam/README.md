# Ansible Collection - kenmoini.phpipam

This collection has a few modules that can help in administering a phpIPAM installation.

It currently does not cover all functions in phpIPAM, but enough to find information about a Subnet, details on an Address, find the first available IP address in a subnet, reserve IP addresses, and release IP addresses.  This can generally cover many use cases for leveraging phpIPAM in Infrastructure as Code scenarios.
